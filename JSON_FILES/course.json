The focus of this course will be on both integration of religious identity factors into conflict analysis and an introduction to faith-based interventions skills, used by religious actors to foster coexistence. During the course, we will explore different types of contemporary conflict in which religion functions as a conflict driver, including how to understand and handle conflicts perpetrated by extremist religious groups. We will also explore the diversity of faith-based reconciliation processes (such as hospitality, healing ritual, apology, etc.) as well as the kinds of roles performed by a wide variety of religious actors (education, advocacy, mediation, dialogue facilitation, etc.). Examples and case studies will be drawn from a wide variety of religious traditions and diverse cultures. In addition to those cases presented in the readings and by the professor, each student will be required to select cases on which to make a class presentation and write a paper.

Talent and industry trump birth and blood, the story goes, and all Americans have the chance to pull themselves up “by the bootstraps.” Yet though the twin “American Dream” of equal opportunity and upward mobility still largely dominates the popular imagination and political rhetoric, social critics have long argued that merit does not necessarily rise in U.S. society; that the system is rigged for the already prosperous and powerful; that an “aristocratic” elite did, does, or will exist in America; and that to rise up into that elite signals probable corruption and perverted values, heartless pragmatism, and/or freakish luck. In an era of public fascination with royalty, dynasties, and heiresses, at a time which finds the unequal distribution of wealth reaching its high water mark, this class will explore the often vexed American relationship with merit and mobility. Is American society meritocratic? Does meritocracy lead to greater equality? In aesthetic representations, what do American meritocrats look like, and what are the necessary conditions for their success? Consulting works by Thomas Jefferson, Tocqueville, Rebecca Harding Davis, Herman Melville, and Mark Twain, among others, we will first seek answers to such questions in American literary history.

We love, as much as hate, monsters because they embody our deep desires that we tend not to acknowledge. Monsters may be not just objects of curiosity but subjects worthy of serious attention, mirroring human nature in a distorted, fragmented, but frank way precisely for their extremity. Among many ways in which monsters illuminate human nature, we will focus on the construction of personal identity in novels and a movie that feature monsters. In the first unit, we will consider how identity is made and unmade by sexual desire in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

In this class, we will attempt to answer this question as we explore one genre: the midcentury pulp novel. Caught between the sexual and gender experimentalism of high modernism and the Stonewall riots, postwar gay and lesbian fiction has been largely overlooked as a dry spell in queer history. The widespread popularity of homoerotic and lesbian-themed fiction has been dismissed as a perverse fascination with the sexual repression and social oppression of gays and lesbians. But what if we read this popularity as a victory of, rather than a failure to, contemporary notions of queerness? What if even the most repressed and frustrated gay and lesbian pulp characters actually present unprecedented complexities, rather than social problems that need to be fixed? By reading homoerotic and lesbian-themed fiction, you will be able to stake your own claims in this debate, making arguments about whether and how these works can be understood as queer.

Despairing melancholic sighs, raging maniac roars, and disturbing hysterical laughter are the soundtrack to these plays that feature, among others, ruthlessly depressed princes, naked and deranged kings, violent and ireful wizards. In this course that blends the study of English Renaissance drama with the History of Medicine, Shakespeare depicts madness as an effect of wild and doubling language, an illness from too much black bile or love, a sickness that makes the body shake and foam and morph into a beast, an attack from evil demons within, and a crime punishable by harsh restraint and incarceration. Emphasizing the wide variety of madnesses in Shakespeare, we will inquire: What is the relationship between madness in these plays and madness in Renaissance medical books, legal documents, sermons, and travel stories? Was madness an inherited condition or an airborne contagion? Was madness racialized? What were the connections between London’s infamous mental hospital (Bethlem – where we get the term “Bedlam”) and one of its most notorious penal institutions (the debtor’s prison, Bridewell)? How might Shakespeare envision his own poetry as madness? We will investigate Shakespeare’s madmen and madwomen both by studying several diseases that were considered forms of madness and by using several types of texts. Some of the diseases: melancholy, lovesickness (AKA “erotic melancholy”), demonic possession, vertigo, and epilepsy. Some 400-year-old texts we may consult: medical/anatomy books, witchcraft legislation, French werewolf tracts, travelogues about Africa, poetry instruction manuals, psychiatric records, bawdy ballads, and bestiaries.

For the purpose of this course we will be focusing on texts that deal with black, white, and Jewish identity in early to mid-twentieth century texts, such as the essays of Adrienne Rich and Audre Lorde, the short stories of Bernard Malamud, and finally Jean Toomer's masterpiece Cane. Each author offers a different approach in their attempt to position themselves in an American context and we will use this work to better understand the intersections of ethnicity, gender, and identity. These works will serve as specific moments of being, and are not intended to be exhaustive. In our writing as well as our reading students will be encouraged to expand upon the vision of the world offered here as we will attempt to better understand the representations and possibilities of identity in this period. In this course students will be introduced to the art of the college essay through a range of writing exercises each designed to prepare students for the three major assignments of a University Writing Seminar, the close reading essay, the lens essay, and finally a research paper.

Outside of ancient Israel, prophets were largely unknown ecstatic visionaries who delivered divine guidance to kings about their political and religious affairs. This type of prophecy also existed in Israel, but from these humble beginnings the concept evolved until the prophets themselves became celebrated figures.  The biblical texts often present them as solitary dissidents standing up for divine justice and denouncing the sins of Israel. After the destruction of Jerusalem in the 6th century B.C.E., the prophets also became voices of consolation to a conquered nation, offering visions of restoration in an idyllic age to come. In this course, we use modern critical methods to study a variety of ancient Near Eastern prophetic texts. For the first essay, we examine the nature of ancient Near Eastern prophecy through a close reading of texts from Mesopotamia and the Levant. Our lens essay focuses on the rise of apocalyptic literature in ancient Israel. Finally, the research paper allows you to explore an \"ancient prophecy\" topic of your choice.

Rappers depend largely on recursive references to themselves and to their musical precursors, and sample-heavy tracks are only a small part of this persistent self-consciousness. Borrowed lyrics, recycled hooks, and constant reconfigurations of featured artists all contribute to the ostensibly closed loop that is contemporary hip-hop. \nThis course will examine hip-hop by analyzing classic albums including The Blueprintby Jay-Z, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, as well contemporary records that aim to deconstruct the very traditions they claim to want to advance, like Kanye West’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy or Kendrick Lamar’s good kid, M.A.A.D city.

As Business Intelligence processes mature, they begin to focus on using data to gain new insights.  We call these processes Business Analytics, and this information is the key to Strategic Decision Making. This course provides students the opportunity to develop an in-depth understanding of the modern uses of business intelligence processes.

When we laugh, must we laugh at something or someone? Why do I sometimes feel such keen discomfort when watching reruns of I Love Lucy or The Office? Such notorious killjoys as Plato, Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, and Immanuel Kant have given their attention to humor, and their evaluations haven't always been positive. Some claim that laughter must necessarily be an expression of contempt for another, that enjoyment of comedy encourages coarseness of feeling and deadens our sympathy for others. These thinkers say that comedy transforms our neighbors' pain and humiliation into entertainment. Certainly, racist or sexist humor seems to operate on this principle, and as the saying goes –– most often attributed to Mel Brooks –– \"Tragedy is when I cut my finger; comedy is when you fall down an open manhole and die.\" However, there are also those who claim that laughter encourages human sympathy and community. Comedy, they claim, can both unite us in common understanding and help us get outside of our petty jealousies and prejudices by giving us a new perspective on the world. Humor, it turns out, may make us more able to care about each other and to understand our world. It may even be one of the more valuable forms of intellectual inquiry available to curious and sympathetic thinkers.\nThis course sets out to investigate the relationship between our capacity to enjoy comedy and our ability to appreciate the experiences of others, and seeks to provide interested students the opportunity to sharpen their academic skills and to deepen their analytic habits of mind. We will examine the real and supposed tensions between comedy and sympathy by carefully considering key ideas from a variety of disciplines and by closely examining examples of humor from literature, the visual arts, and performances in television or film. The question of what we find funny and how we ought to regard that feeling offers ample opportunity to rigorously investigate examples of humor, to engage critically the often contentious scholarship that considers that question, and to produce original research suggesting some kind of answer to it over the course of three substantive essay assignments. Students will leave the course with experience in applying essential strategies for framing and working through analytic questions in writing, amply prepared to begin with confidence their scholastic careers at Brandeis.\nMr. Plunkett","requirements":["UWS"],"independent_study":false,"name":"Comedy and Sympathy","subjects":[{"segment":"2","id":"1161-7050"}]},{"credits":null,"description":"Noncredit.\n\nUsually offered every year.\nStaff","requirements":[],"code":"BUS 248B","name":"Business in Global Markets","subjects":[{"id":"1161-3600","segment":"1"}],"independent_study":false},{"independent_study":false,"name":"Policy Analysis and Design in the Developing World","subjects":[{"segment":"2","id":"1161-2900"}],"code":"HS 302F","credits":null,"description":"Meets for one-half semester and yields half-course credit. \n\nIntroduces students to the tools of policy analysis that were originally created in and for advanced industrial societies, and explores how these tools can be modified to fit and be useful in the developing world context.
